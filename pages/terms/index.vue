        <h3 class="mb-4">PLEASE READ THESE TERMS and Conditions BEFORE USING THE WEBSITE AND OUR SERVICES</h3>

        <h4 class="mb-3 mt-3">1. GENERAL STATEMENTS</h4>

        <p>
          These Terms and Conditions constitute the agreement made between the user (“you” or “User”), whether a private individual or
          representing an entity or organization and the partnership of the Founders (“we” or “Founders”) of the millionpieces Project
          (“Project” or “millionpieces”) concerning the access to and use of the website www.millionpieces.io and the respective
          smart-contract as well as any other application, media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application, smart contracts
          to be related, linked, or otherwise connected and developed thereto now or in the future (collectively the “website”, Site”). On
          millionpieces.io digital collages (called “Artworks”), which consist of 10.000 segments each will be created where users can
          contribute to the look by uploading images to fill the segments. Every segment is linked to a digital Certificate that is minted
          on the Ethereum blockchain and is represented by a non-fungible token (“NFT”). Each NFT minted for the millionpieces Project
          functions as a key to unlock the uploading mechanism for an image of a specific segment and to add (social media) links, which
          will be visible after hovering over a segment of the artwork. The Image of the digital Certificate will be uploaded via IPFS to
          preserve the decentralized character. The smart contract of millionpieces allows participants to purchase the NFT representing the
          segments of an Artwork. After the purchase the NFT will be transferred from the Ethereum smart contract to the purchaser
          (“Purchaser”) and concludes the business transaction between the respective parties. Before you purchase an NFT and use the UI and
          the Ethereum smart contracts, you will need to agree to these Terms and Conditions and any terms and conditions incorporated
          herein by reference (collectively, these "Terms"). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE MAKING A PURCHASE OF AN NFT VIA THE
          millionpieces WEBSITE. THESE TERMS GOVERN THE PURCHASE OF THE NFT, UNLESS THE FOUNDERS HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT
          WITH THE PURCHASER FOR THAT PURPOSE. ACCEPTING THESE TERMS and CONDITIONS ALSO SHALL MEAN THAT THE PURCHASER CONFIRMS TO FULLY
          UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF THESE TERMS ARE BEING ACCEPTED ON BEHALF OF ANY ORGANIZATION, COMPANY
          OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, IT SHALL BE ASSUMED THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE MAKING SUCH DECLARATION HAS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE
          TERMS ON THAT ENTITY’S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” OR THE “PURCHASER” WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY. IF THE REPRESENTATIVE DOES NOT HAVE
          SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF ALL OF THESE TERMS ARE NOT ACCEPTED, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE
          AVAILABLE TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE AND NOT ENTITLED
          TO PURCHASE THE NFT. COOKIES: You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or

          than through Ethereum-compatible browsers. Transactions on the Site are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. We have
          absolutely no effect or control on MetaMask, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other third-party site, product, or
          service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the Site and make the transaction. We will not

        </p>

        <h4 class="mb-3 mt-3">3. PURCHASE OF THE NFTs</h4>

        <p>
          If you decide to purchase a NFT of the Project, any financial transactions will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network.
          The Purchaser shall acknowledge that the Founders have no liability to the Purchaser or to any third party for any material or
          immaterial claims, damages or costs that may arise as a result of any transactions that is engaged by means of the Site, or using

          made, we have no control to reverse any transaction and we have no control over the payment system and mechanism whatsoever. The
          Purchaser shall acknowledge that is solely responsible for his/her MetaMask wallet, and other Ethereum wallets, if applicable and
          the private key to access it. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs
          on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that
          you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Site. The Gas Fee does not constitute part of the NFT
          price, we do not benefit from that at all and we have no control over its pricing. All paid prices exclude any possible duties or
          charges. You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added, and other taxes, duties and customs if
          applicable in relation to the purchase and ownership of the NFT from the Projects collections, now or hereafter claimed or imposed
          by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”), under any jurisdiction in the world, under any tax laws and treaties. The
          Purchaser shall declare and warrant that is not resident (including tax resident) in any of the countries which have any – even
          partial – legal restriction regarding the purchase, acquisition, ownership of any crypto currencies, crypto tokens, cyber

          attempt to do any action directly or indirectly what should mean the breach money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws
          under any jurisdiction the Purchaser is related to.

        <h4 class="mb-3 mt-3">13. MISCELLANEOUS</h4>

        <p>
          If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be
          modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. Otherwise, that provision should be removed. Neither the exercise
          of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement. These
          Terms and all claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement, or the breach thereof, whether in contract, otherwise, shall be
          governed by Law of Country of Founders residence, provided that the law there has legal solutions to such dispute. It is
          understood that market customs and practice also shall be considered in any dispute. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out
          of, or in relation to, this Agreement, including the validity, invalidity, breach, or termination thereof, shall be resolved
          amicably via a mutually appointed experienced mediator and if the (preferably online) mediation was not successful within 3
          months, then the dispute should be solved by the competent courts of the Country of Founders residence. These Terms and any
          policies or operating rules posted by us on the Site, or in respect to the Site constitute the entire agreement and understanding
          between you and the Founders. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a
          waiver of such right or provision. These Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We shall not be responsible or
          liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part
          of a provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, and unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is
          deemed severable these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
